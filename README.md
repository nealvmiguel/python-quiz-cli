# Python Quiz App

A simple command-line quiz application built in Python.  
The app presents a set of multiple-choice questions, tracks your score, and displays a summary at the end.  
The quiz questions are stored in a **custom JSON file** that I created for this project.


## Features
- Multiple-choice quiz with different difficulty levels.
- Score tracking and final summary display.
- Questions loaded from a custom JSON file.
- Simple and clean command-line interface.
